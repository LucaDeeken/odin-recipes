# Tasty Recipes

>A treat for the discerning palate and a playground for learning HTML/CSS!

## My First Project
This is my very first project where I applied basic HTML structure, linking between pages, and simple web development techniques such as creating directories and links.

## Task
As part of this task, I created a webpage that contains a collection of recipes. The structure includes:

**index.html** – The main page with links to different recipes.

**Recipes** – A collection of HTML files within their own directory (e.g., recipes/cheesecake.html), each containing a recipe.

**Recipe Pages** – Each recipe page contains:

- An image of the finished dish

- A brief description of the recipe

- A list of ingredients

- Step-by-step instructions for preparing the dish
